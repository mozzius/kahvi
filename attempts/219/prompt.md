# Ticket B-array-prototype-find-index: Array.prototype.findIndex

Implement this built-in in its file, following the spec steps already in
the stub: keep each step as a comment directly above the code for it.

- Abstract operations are in `kahvi_core::ops` (see docs/API.md); use them
  rather than re-implementing. If a helper you need is missing and other
  built-ins would need it too, write it in your file and say so in your
  final report; do not edit other files.
- Anything you cannot finish must still return
  `Err(agent.not_implemented("..."))` naming what is missing. Never return
  a made-up value.
- No new Rust tests: the test262 target is the measure.

## Spec

Array.prototype.findIndex ( _predicate_ [ , _thisArg_ ] )
  id: sec-array.prototype.findindex   type: built-in function

NOTE:
This method calls _predicate_ once for each element of the array, in ascending index order, until it finds one where _predicate_ returns a value that coerces to *true*. If such an element is found, `findIndex` immediately returns the index of that element value. Otherwise, `findIndex` returns -1.
See FindViaPredicate for additional information.
This method performs the following steps when called:

1. Let _obj_ be ? ToObject(*this* value).
2. Let _length_ be ? LengthOfArrayLike(_obj_).
3. Let _findRecord_ be ? FindViaPredicate(_obj_, _length_, ~ascending~, _predicate_, _thisArg_).
4. Return _findRecord_.[[Index]].

NOTE:
This method is intentionally generic; it does not require that its *this* value be an Array. Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

--- referenced: ToObject ( _arg_: an ECMAScript language value, ): either a normal completion containing an Object or a throw completion
  id: sec-toobject

description: It converts _arg_ to a value of type Object.

1. If _arg_ is either *undefined* or *null*, throw a *TypeError* exception.
2. If _arg_ is a Boolean, return a new Boolean object whose [[BooleanData]] internal slot is set to _arg_. See [sec-boolean-objects] for a description of Boolean objects.
3. If _arg_ is a Number, return a new Number object whose [[NumberData]] internal slot is set to _arg_. See [sec-number-objects] for a description of Number objects.
4. If _arg_ is a String, return a new String object whose [[StringData]] internal slot is set to _arg_. See [sec-string-objects] for a description of String objects.
5. If _arg_ is a Symbol, return a new Symbol object whose [[SymbolData]] internal slot is set to _arg_. See [sec-symbol-objects] for a description of Symbol objects.
6. If _arg_ is a BigInt, return a new BigInt object whose [[BigIntData]] internal slot is set to _arg_. See [sec-bigint-objects] for a description of BigInt objects.
7. Assert: _arg_ is an Object.
8. Return _arg_.

--- referenced: LengthOfArrayLike ( _obj_: an Object, ): either a normal completion containing a non-negative integer or a throw completion
  id: sec-lengthofarraylike

description: It returns the value of the *"length"* property of an array-like object.

1. Return ℝ(? ToLength(? Get(_obj_, *"length"*))).

An array-like object is any object for which this operation returns a normal completion.
NOTE:
Typically, an array-like object would also have some properties with integer index names. However, that is not a requirement of this definition.
NOTE:
Arrays and String objects are examples of array-like objects.


## Done when

- Every test262 run under built-ins/Array/prototype/findIndex/ passes (check with `./t262 built-ins/Array/prototype/findIndex/`). 8 pass on the main branch right now.
