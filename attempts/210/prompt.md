# Ticket B-string-prototype-concat: String.prototype.concat

Implement this built-in in its file, following the spec steps already in
the stub: keep each step as a comment directly above the code for it.

- Abstract operations are in `kahvi_core::ops` (see docs/API.md); use them
  rather than re-implementing. If a helper you need is missing and other
  built-ins would need it too, write it in your file and say so in your
  final report; do not edit other files.
- Anything you cannot finish must still return
  `Err(agent.not_implemented("..."))` naming what is missing. Never return
  a made-up value.
- No new Rust tests: the test262 target is the measure.

## Spec

String.prototype.concat ( ..._args_ )
  id: sec-string.prototype.concat   type: built-in function

NOTE:
When this method is called it returns the String value consisting of the code units of the *this* value (converted to a String) followed by the code units of each of the arguments converted to a String. The result is a String value, not a String object.
This method performs the following steps when called:

1. Let _thisValue_ be the *this* value.
2. Perform ? RequireObjectCoercible(_thisValue_).
3. Let _string_ be ? ToString(_thisValue_).
4. Let _result_ be _string_.
5. For each element _next_ of _args_, do
   a. Let _nextString_ be ? ToString(_next_).
   b. Set _result_ to the string-concatenation of _result_ and _nextString_.
6. Return _result_.

The *"length"* property of this method is *1*_𝔽.
NOTE:
This method is intentionally generic; it does not require that its *this* value be a String object. Therefore it can be transferred to other kinds of objects for use as a method.

--- referenced: RequireObjectCoercible ( _arg_: an ECMAScript language value, ): either a normal completion containing ~unused~ or a throw completion
  id: sec-requireobjectcoercible

description: It throws an error if _arg_ is a value that cannot be converted to an Object using ToObject.

1. If _arg_ is either *undefined* or *null*, throw a *TypeError* exception.
2. Return ~unused~.

--- referenced: ToString ( _arg_: an ECMAScript language value, ): either a normal completion containing a String or a throw completion
  id: sec-tostring

description: It converts _arg_ to a value of type String.

1. If _arg_ is a String, return _arg_.
2. If _arg_ is a Symbol, throw a *TypeError* exception.
3. If _arg_ is *undefined*, return *"undefined"*.
4. If _arg_ is *null*, return *"null"*.
5. If _arg_ is *true*, return *"true"*.
6. If _arg_ is *false*, return *"false"*.
7. If _arg_ is a Number, return Number::toString(_arg_, 10).
8. If _arg_ is a BigInt, return BigInt::toString(_arg_, 10).
9. Assert: _arg_ is an Object.
10. Let _primitiveValue_ be ? ToPrimitive(_arg_, ~string~).
11. Assert: _primitiveValue_ is not an Object.
12. Return ? ToString(_primitiveValue_).


## Done when

- Every test262 run under built-ins/String/prototype/concat/ passes (check with `./t262 built-ins/String/prototype/concat/`). 16 pass on the main branch right now.
