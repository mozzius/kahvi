Implement this built-in in its file, following the spec steps already in
the stub: keep each step as a comment directly above the code for it.

- Abstract operations are in `kahvi_core::ops` (see docs/API.md); use them
  rather than re-implementing. If a helper you need is missing and other
  built-ins would need it too, write it in your file and say so in your
  final report; do not edit other files.
- Anything you cannot finish must still return
  `Err(agent.not_implemented("..."))` naming what is missing. Never return
  a made-up value.
- No new Rust tests: the test262 target is the measure.
